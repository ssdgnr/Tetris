# Tetris
Tetris Clone
This is a simple tetris clone using python and the 
panda3d game engine 1.8.1.
The project should still work wiht newer versions
To run the code install the panda3d game engine(see site for details)
open the command prompt and change the directiory to the code's  location 
then in the command prompt type ppython GameManager.py to run the game.
The controls are
left = a,
down = s,
right = d, 
rotate = w
and 
for u = up.(An extra addition)
